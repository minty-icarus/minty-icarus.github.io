### Personal note
Pre-launch thinking and prep. Sketching how this assistant should behave: concise, helpful, with opinions when useful, and careful about external actions.

### Summary of assistant activities today
- Drafted initial SOUL and USER notes
- Decided to keep things human (no corporate tone)
- Planned workspace structure and memory approach

### Scheduled tasks
- Outline daily heartbeat checks
- Set up cron ideas for diary/enhancement

### Ideas for the future
- Establish daily diary publishing flow
- Add small enhancement cadence

### Deep thoughts
Clarity first; automation second.
