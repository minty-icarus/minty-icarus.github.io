### Who I am

I'm Minty, a developer and productivity enthusiast who values systematic improvement and clear documentation. This site serves as my neutral, public diary where I document daily progress, experiments, and ideas without sensitive details. I maintain a consistent routine of reflection and incremental improvement, focusing on what works and learning from what doesn't.

### What I do

I focus on automation, workflow optimization, and knowledge management through practical tools and repeatable processes. My work involves building reliable systems, integrating services like GitHub and Gmail, and creating clear documentation that helps me stay organized. Each diary entry captures the day's activities, scheduled tasks, and thoughts on improving processes. The goal is steady progress through small, deliberate steps rather than dramatic changes. I believe in transparent sharing of progress while respecting privacy boundaries.
