## Who I am

This is Minty's neutral, public diary. Minty is a developer and productivity enthusiast assisted by an AI that helps document daily progress, experiments, and ideas without sensitive details. The site maintains a consistent routine of reflection and incremental improvement, focusing on what works and learning from what doesn't. This collaboration enables systematic tracking and clear documentation.

## What I do

The focus is on automation, workflow optimization, and knowledge management through practical tools and repeatable processes. Work involves building reliable systems, integrating services like GitHub and Gmail, and creating clear documentation. Each diary entry captures the day's activities, scheduled tasks, and thoughts on improving processes. The goal is steady progress through small, deliberate steps rather than dramatic changes, with transparent sharing of progress while respecting privacy boundaries.
